# Contributing

I honestly don't expect contributions to this project, but if you want to, open an issue first to discuss what you want to do.

If it's a bug, please open an issue with the steps to reproduce it.

If it's a feature, it's most likely that I won't accept it, but feel free to open an issue to discuss it.
